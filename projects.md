### Simulation: Bayesian Aggregation of Evidence for Informative Hypotheses 
This project constitutes my M.Sc. thesis. Against the background of the current replication crisis in the behavioral sciences, it suggests a Bayesian method that allows researchers to construct combined evidence from a variety of studies for *informative hypotheses* that are common in behavioral research. A simulation study investigates how this method behaves for varying sample sizes, effect sizes and statistical models. The ultimate goal is to provide the field with a well-performing method that allows researchers to directly aggregate evidence for informative hypotheses from different statistical models such as linear, logistic and multilevel regression. Check out a preliminary version of the thesis and all simulation code on [Github](https://github.com/Lion-Be/combining_evidence)!   

### Application: Bayesian Aggregation of Evidence for Informative Hypotheses 
Some fellow researchers at Utrecht's [Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences) and me apply the above mentioned method for the first time. Using an example on trust problems in social and economic exchange, we combine evidence from linear, probit and multilevel models. 

### Linear Versus Curvilinear Theories on Political Participation and Legitimacy
This paper re-evaluates the effects that varying levels of political systems' perceived legitimacy exert on different forms of political participation. Traditionally, it has been hypothesized that citizens with faith in their political system are active through conventional participation channels (e.g. voting, partisan membership), while alienated citizens go protesting and petitioning. In this project, I examine the potential of a *curvilinear theory* stating that both faithful and alienated citizens should be active in all channels, while the indifferent remain passive.
