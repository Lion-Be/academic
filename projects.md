### Combining Evidence for Informative Hypotheses From Multiple Studies â€“ A Simulation Study Investigating the Behavior of Bayes Factors
Much attention has been given to the question of how to quantify evidence for informative (inequality constrained) hypotheses. In a Bayesian framework, the current state-of-the-art assesses such with Bayes factors comparing the performance of competing hypotheses against each other. As in recent years, calls for replication studies are rising and researchers increasingly aim to evaluate informative hypotheses using multiple studies, the question of how to combine/aggregate evidence from these measures is of high importance. Aggregated measures need to provide valid results even if evidence from different study designs, models and measurements are combined.

Through a variety of simulation studies, this project assesses how powerful Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities are in detecting the true hypothesis if multiple studies yielding congruent or mixed results are combined.

### Linear Versus Curvilinear Theories on Political Participation and Legitimacy
Literature on the relation between support for the political system and individual political participation patterns has long adopted 
linear reasoning. High levels of support are argued to be associated with institutionalized, within-system engagement, 
while negative attitudes towards system and elites are expected to lead to non-institutionalized, grass-rout driven political action. 
Challenging conventional argumentation lines, Booth and Seligson (2009) recently introduced a curvilinear approach to the literature.
Arguing for U-shaped relations, this approach expects both the positively and negatively orientated individuals to engage in both 
institutionalized and non-institutionalized participation forms, while the indifferent should remain non-active. 
Currently, evidence is unclear. Using survey data of the Latin American Opinion Project (2012) on 24 democracies and 
applying eight logistic multilevel models, this article contrasts these theories and tests both. 
Evidence shows to be clearly in favor of the linear approach. Scholars are thus well advised to stick to linear reasoning.
