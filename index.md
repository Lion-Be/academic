I am an early career researcher currently studying Methodology & Statistics (M.Sc.) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences). I hold a B.A. in Political Science from the [University of Bremen](https://www.politik.uni-bremen.de/ccm/navigation/index.en). Througout my formation, I have had various research stays at institutions such as the [Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de/), the [Latin American Social Science Institute (FLACSO, Ecuador)](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/portal/en) and the [Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS)](https://www.gesis.org/en/home/).  

My primary areas of research are political behavior and comparative politics. My Master's thesis is located in the field of Bayesian statistics and investigates the behaviour of Bayes factors that are combined from multiple studies. Additionally, I hold a strong interest in data science, causal inference and anything methods-related in general.
