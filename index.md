I am an early career researcher currently studying Methodology & Statistics (M.Sc.) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences). From July 2018, I will be a research fellow at the [Collaborative Research Center 884 "The Political Economy of Reforms"](http://reforms.uni-mannheim.de/) at Mannheim University. Througout my formation, I had various research stays at institutions such as the [Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de/), the [Latin American Social Science Institute (FLACSO, Ecuador)](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/portal/en) and the [Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS)](https://www.gesis.org/en/home/).  

My primary areas of research are political behavior and comparative politics. Next to that, I am enthusiastic about anything statistics- and methods-related, especially about Bayesian statistics and R. Check out my current research projects [here](https://lion-be.github.io/projects.html)!
