I am an early career researcher currently studying Methodology & Statistics (M.Sc.) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences). From July 2018, I will be a research fellow at the [Collaborative Research Center 884 "The Political Economy of Reforms"](http://reforms.uni-mannheim.de/) at Mannheim University. Througout my formation, I had various research stays at institutions such as the [Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de/), the [Latin American Social Science Institute (FLACSO, Ecuador)](https://www.flacso.edu.ec/portal/en) and the [Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS)](https://www.gesis.org/en/home/).  

My primary areas of research are political behavior and comparative politics. My Master's thesis is located in the field of Bayesian statistics and investigates the behavior of Bayes factors that are combined from multiple studies. Additionally, I hold a strong interest in data science, causal inference and anything methods-related in general.
